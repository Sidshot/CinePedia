# CineAmore: The Manifesto

> "CineAmore is ever expanding. It is a place where users will find curated films, not 'everything is here, go choose'."

## 1. Core Philosophy: Curation Over Chaos
CineAmore is **not a dump** of every movie ever made. It is a handheld guide through cinema.
*   **What we are:** A curated library where every entry is worth considering.
*   **What we are not:** An automated scraper that dumps 100,000 low-quality links.
*   **The User's Role:** Users start with our curation but have the liberty to refine, organize, and create their own collections (via Lists).

## 2. Feature Boundaries & Ethics
We operate with a long-term vision. Stability and legality dictate our feature set.

### Streaming (Direct Play)
*   **Status:** Future Roadmap.
*   **Condition:** Will be added "as userbase increases and legality issues are taken care of."
*   **Why wait?** We prioritize platform survival over quick convenience.

### Torrent Embedding
*   **Status:** Conditional Future.
*   **Condition:** Only "if/when legality issues are taken care of."
*   **Stance:** We do not expose the platform to unnecessary risk today.

## 3. Communication Channel
We value direct lines of communication, but we keep the platform focused on the content.
*   **Support/Inquiries:** Direct answers via Telegram.

## 4. The "Hard Gate" Rule
To ensure CineAmore remains robust, we adhere to strict development phases.
*   **No new features** on a shaky foundation.
*   **Sanitize first, build second.** (e.g., Schema freezes, Migration sprints).
